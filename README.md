# React + Vite

In this first I learned about the basics of react and also built the basic Ludo Game and also built the very Simple ToDo List in React.

# LUDO-GAME
In whiuch I simply created the button of four colors that on click the button update the value of count.

# TODO LIST
The Todo List conatain the functionality:
1:Add the Task
2:Delete the task
3:Mak as One (This is for when one task is done)
4:Mark all Done(Thius is for when all the task are done)
5:Uppercase/LowerCase letter (I n code the func tionality of all or one task in uppercase or lowercase letter is written. 


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
